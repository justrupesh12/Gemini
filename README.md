# Gemini
Gemini intro (text to text and image to text with the help of gemini api key)

##Summary
You install the SDK and authenticate using your API key.

You create a model instance (gemini-2.5-pro) and use .generate_content() for text or image-based prompts.

Gemini supports multimodal input, meaning you can pass both text and images for richer interactions.
